Therefore, your graph is incorrect (-3)","#10 you need a counterexample (-1)","#10 you calculated for Jerry -- what about Ben?","#10)  You can first get arc x by looking at the inscribe angle 79º.  Double the 79 to get its intercepted arc AC then subtract 82 = that will give you arc x.   You would do something similar to get z by doubling 97 and then subtract off 82.  To get angle y you can add together its intercepted arcs and divide by 2.","#6)  Collinear means in the same line.","#6 y=-x+5 Great Job!!","#6 you did identify the reactants and products specifically -- I think they were getting at knowing the reactants are on the left, and the products are on the right (but your answer also works) -- it also asked for you to identify each substance as solid (s), liquid (l), gas (g), or solution (aq) -- which I don't think you did","#6 you plugged it in for JM not JL (-1)","#6's graph doesn't indicate less than","#6)  Area formula for a circle is pi radius squared.","#6(D)(-1)","#6(e) relatively speaking, R has a lower amplitude than P, so I might say Q and R","#6 you have to find the value of g(2) first and then multiply that by 2 (-5)","#6 you don't know the length, so you can't calculate it this way.

Now you can find the vertex angle since all angles of a triangle add up to 180.  Once you get the vertex angle the angle x is a linear pair with that vertex angle.","#2)  If a figure has 5 sides then it is a pentagon.  This is a True statement since there are no counterexamples.","#2)  Lines that are parallel to GE cannot be skew.

If c squared is less then it is an acute triangle since the length of c will be shorter.","#2)  Since you have two tangent lines you will get two right angles in this quadrilateral.  We know that all quadrilaterals have the sum of the angle measures as 360º [(n-2)(180)].  Add up 90 + 90 + 135 + x = 360 and solve.","#2)  The area of this rhombus is (d1 • d2) / 2   so you have the first diagonal but to get the second you need to use the fact that a rhombus has diagonals that are perpendicular so you will use the pythagorean theorem to get the other leg (the other 1/2 diagonal length)","#2)  The area of a rhombus is 1/2 D1 times D2.  You have D1 = 6 [3 + 3]  To get D2 you need to use the pythagorean theorem.  3 squared = x squared = 8 squared.","#2)  Since we have two congruent sides of this triangle the angles opposite them are congruent.  That gives us two base angles of 27º then find the vertex angle.  Angle x is a linear pair with that vertex angle.","#2)  Now that you found square root of 55 you double that to get the entire length of the diagonal.","#2)  The angle of depression is 29º so the angle is from the horizontal down.  It is equivalent to the angle of elevation that is located at the boat since these two angles are alternate interior angles.  You have the 29º in the wrong spot.","#2)  Look at the given in this problem.  If I have line 1 parallel to line 2 and line 2 parallel to line 3 then what do we know about how line 1 and line 3 relate?","#2)  Look at the intersection again","#2)  Stating Polygon does not prove this statement to be false.

Notice that you are multiplying in the 5 to the terms in the parenthesis.  What property says we can do this?","#3)  Look at your answers here.  You might want to start with the relationship between <x and the 82º angle.  Note the parallel lines.  Then once you get x you can get y since all the angles of a triangle add up to 180º.  Then you can get z since z and y are a linear pair.","#3)  Look again where these planes intersect.  You might want to use a highlighter.","#3)  Line 4.  Notice that you are switching the location around the equals here.  What property allows you to do that?","#3)  Look at your reasoning again here.  You will subtract 10 from both sides to get x = 5.","#3)  Look at this intersection again","#3)  The angle at the top of the triangle should be 20º not 40º since the apothem will bisect that angle.","#3)  Now plug it in to get the lengths of the three sides","#3)  Set 4500 pi equal to 4/3 pi radius cubed.  Then solve","#3)  There are 31 people who like to cook and garden so you will put this over the total.","#3)  Take the cube root of 3375 again.","#3)  We know that m<90º so we have a right triangle and we can use the pythagorean theorem.  The radius is x so that makes one leg x the other leg (BC) 11 and the hypotenuse x + 7.  When you set this up to use the pythagorean theorem you will get a binomial squared so make sure you multiply each term through.","#3)  You can first find angle x since it is Alternate Interior to the 82º and then you can find y since all the angles of a triangle add up to be 180.  Then you can find z since y and z are a linear pair.","#3)  Two planes intersect at a line","#3)  To start take your triangle and draw the apothem (the perpendicular bisector to the side) then use trig to get the apothem and side length","#3)  You solved for x (half of one side length) but you need the perimeter.","#3)  You did not multiply the binomial out correctly here.  You need to write it out twice (x + 7) (x + 7) then distribute the x in both terms then distribute the 7 into both terms.  Then add like terms and solve.","#3)  The angle of the large triangle is 40 so you need to divide by 2 to get the angle at the top of the right triangle.","#3)  Use your guided notes to find the algebraic properties that will be used for these examples.","#3)  Look where these planes intersect again.  You might want to use color.","#3)  To reflect over the line y = x (you graphed it correctly) you need to go from point A and travel in a slope of -1 to the line of reflection and then go that same diagonal distance on the other side of the line of reflection.  Do that for each point","#3)  You reflected over the line y = -x since you graphed a line with the slope of -1.  You want to reflect over the line y = x (y-int of zero and a slope of 1)","#3)  The perimeter is 96 and we are not using Angle Measures here","#3)  You should start by dividing by pi on both sides then divide by 4/3 and take the cube root.","#3)  Two planes intersect at a line so you will need to have a line here.  Two points with a line above it.","#3)  Your perimeter is not correct here","#3)  To get the angles from smallest to largest you start with the shortest side (CB) and then know that the smallest angle is opposite (<A),  The the next longest side will have the next largest  angle opposite.","#7 is cut off ???","#7 is incorrect","#7 is incorrect (-2)","#7 is incorrec","#7 is correct!","#7 is done much like #2.

Although our society generally believes that stress is bad, Kaufer’s research has shown that a mild and brief experience of stress can have great advantages including improved alertness, performance and memory. Kaufer’s research on rats demonstrates this, and she believes the results are the same for people. However, individuals vary on how much stress is harmful for them based on their resilience, confidence, control of the situation and early life exerpeinces. Furthermore, stress can also affect your physical health: increasing heart disease, suppressing the immune system, decreasing fertility and causing Post Traumatic Stress Disorder (PTSD). In conclusion, Kaufer says that there are strategies to reduce stress, such as a positive attitude, a social support network and physical exercise, so even if we can’t prevent things that stress us, we can at least try to help it benefit us.","The correct nth term for 1(c) is Xn = X^(n+2)   (Note:'^' means 'to the power of'","Solution  with out the  diagram   ?","The ideas here are really cool, but your hierarchy seems reversed.
